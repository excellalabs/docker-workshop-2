# Workshop: Intro to Container Managment using Kubernetes

**TODO:**

- change image used in deployment & service to be the same. Use a multi-container app if it's feasible for the timeframe.
- add step of creating deployment and service with manifest: put manifest into /examples folder and add apply/etc commands
    - put manifest files into this repo (/examples)
- add step to deployment exercise to kill one and have it spin back up
- Add exercise for updating app
- high level, what is the kubead command doing when it creates the cluster
    - does this section need to be in our readme? More inf

        To start using your cluster, you need to run (as a regular user):

        mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
        sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config



- Topics to be ready to address:

    * Architecture of Kubernets (see Pluralsight 3 hour Nigel course)
    * Docker integration
        - Docker networking expansion
            - [Container Network Model (CNM) design spec]()

    * Linux integratioons
    * Windows kernal integations
    * Maintain cluster in EC2, EKS, GCP
    * Set up cluster from scratch
